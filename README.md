# Python Data types
In general there are 4 data types in python to work with.
# 1.String
In day 1 we have discussed about what is a string.We can print a string by enclosing them With " " within the print().That will print the whole string.BUt what if we want to yield a particular character from a word and print it.Yes,it can be done! Pulling out a particular element from a string is called subscripting.
Example:

This is done by adding '[]'.But why typing 1 inside [] yields the 2nd letter?Its because python starts its indexing from 0 i.e. in the string "Hello",index 0 pulls out the letter "H". And similarly index 1 pulls out the element "e".
Therefore:-

# 2.Integer
Integers are positive and negative whole numbers.

12 #is an integer.

We usually write large integer numbers like 1,20,000 separated by commas.In pytyhon we can write the large integers with underscore as 1_20_000 where the program will ignore the underscore during execution
(only for human ease).

# 3.Float
The numbers which are separated by floating points i.e. why these are called floating point numbers.
Example: 
1.230 #is a float.

# 4.Boolean
This includes True and False followed by first letter as capital.It is used check whether the condition is True or False.

While doing programming, we can also  check the type of the variables by using  type() function.
