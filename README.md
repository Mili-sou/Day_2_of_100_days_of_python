# Python Data types
In general there are 4 data types in python to work with.
# 1.String
In day 1 we have discussed about what is a string.We can print a string by enclosing them With " " within the print().That will print the whole string.BUt what if we want to yield a particular character from a word and print it.Yes,it can be done! Pulling out a particular element from a string is called subscripting.
Example:

This is done by adding '[]'.But why typing 1 inside [] yields the 2nd letter?Its because python starts its indexing from 0 i.e. in the string "Hello",index 0 pulls out the letter "H". And similarly index 1 pulls out the element "e".
Therefore:-

# 2.Integer
Integers are positive and negative whole numbers.
